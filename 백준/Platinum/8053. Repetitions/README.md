### 문제 설명

<p>A sequence of words over alphabet [‘a’,…,’z’] is given. The length of longest word occuring as a coherent fragment in every word given is to be found.</p>

<p>Write a program which:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reads the sequence of words from the standard input,</li>
	<li>counts the length of the longest word occuring as a coherent fragment in every word given,</li>
	<li>writes the result to the standard output.</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <p>In the first line of the standard input there is an integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 is the number of words. In each of the next n lines there is one word formed from small letters of English alphabet [‘a’,…,’z’]. The length of each word is at least 1, but not greater than 2,000.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The text of standard output should consist of exactly one line containing a single integer equal to the length of the longest word occuring as the coherent fragment in every word given.</p>
